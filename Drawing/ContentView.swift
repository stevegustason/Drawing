// Instead of paths, which use absolute coordinates, we can use shapes. Because we're handed the size the shape will be used at, we know exactly how big to draw our path and don't need to rely on fixed coordinates.
struct Triangle: Shape {
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        var path = Path()

        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.midX, y: rect.minY))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.maxY))

    }
}

// Paths are designed to do one specific thing, whereas shapes have flexibility of drawing space and you can pass them parameters to customize them. For example, our arc has three parameters below. Note that arcs are usually not InsettableShapes like circles are, which means you can't use a strokeBorder because the shape can't be inset or reduced inwards. To fix that, we add an insetAmount variable and a inset(by:) function, and then add that it now conforms to InsettableShape.
struct Arc: Shape, InsettableShape {
    var startAngle: Angle
